##Build a Music Discovery Service

Create a community-based music sharing and discovery site.
Allow users to upload their music, tag and catergorize their music.
Let users see beautiful visualizations the music audio tracks.

###Choose a Serverless Stack
Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App (SPA) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities. 

Cloudinary's APIs work extremely well with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration). 

### Use This Guide As Starting Point
We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.
