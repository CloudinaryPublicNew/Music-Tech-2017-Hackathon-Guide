##Build Styled Fan Pages from Artist Photos

Use style transfer to generate neural artwork styled images with the artist branded graphics by processing fan photos, venue/event photos of artist events, etc.

###Choose a Serverless Stack
Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App (SPA) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities. 

Cloudinary's APIs work extremely well with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration). 

### Use This Guide As Starting Point
We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet and Share about your experience at this hackathon!
We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging.  Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media.   In fact we've added links to the top of this guide so you can do just that. Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about the technologies right along with you.
