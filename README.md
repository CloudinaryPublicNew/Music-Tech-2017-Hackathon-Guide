At Cloudinary, we believe images and visuals greatly enhance the user experience of music and video. As a powerful API for media management, we let developers handle images, videos, audio, and emerging media types. End-to-end automation includes media selection, upload, analysis, administration, manipulation, optimization and delivery. 

We're hackers too, so we know your time at the hackathon is limited. That's why we've developed this guide to help you harness our technology to realize your ideas in the most efficient way possible.
